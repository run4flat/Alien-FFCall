NAME

Alien::FFCall - an Alien package for the FFCall library (predecessor to libffi)

DESCRIPTION

This is maintained primarily for historical reasons. If you want a foreign
function interface, you should look into FFI::Platypus, which uses the
more robust and currently maintained libffi, rather than the older ffcall.

This Alien package, built on Alien::Base, provides the FFCall library. FFCall
has been surpassed by libffi and is rather hard to obtain these days, but Perl's
original FFI module is built upon FFCall, so I decided to make it easy to distribute
FFCall on CPAN.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

The best place to get help for this module is to file Issues on github:

    https://github.com/run4flat/Alien-FFCall/issues

Mostly, I don't expect that you'll want to use this module directly, but
should look into FFI:
